Lab 3: Modifying and Rewriting Software

Our main goal for this lab is to install coreutils and apply a patch
that fixes the date format under the ls command for all users.

After thoroughly reading through the specs, we grab the download
the coreutils 7.6 file using:

wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

and from here move the file into lab3 directory:

mv coreutils-7.6.tar.gz ~/CS35L/lab3

Next, unzip the tar file and make a directory for it.

tar -xzvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

mkdir coreutilsInstall


Next, to the coreutils directory and install the file. Make
sure
to read the information for INSTALL (man INSTALL).
Set the prefix to the coreutilesInstall directory, so
that the files will be installed there, since we do not
have permission to install into the default directory.

./configure --prefix=/w/home.05/cs/ugrad/ross/CS35L/
lab3/coreutilsInstall

(Note: the whole address must be used, without shortcuts
or else make install will not work)

Next, make and make install to actually install the files.

make

make install

After installing, we now want to test the bug by running
coreutil's version of ls as follows (make sure you are in
the coreutilsInstall directory):

./bin/ls -l

We use -l for long-list format so it displays the date
as well as other things about the files.

When we run it, we find that the date format is wrong.

It reads:
2015-10-16

When we want:
Oct 16 2015


So from here, the next step is to apply a patch. So we
need to copy and paste Brady's patch into an emacs file.

emacs patch

and then copy and paste the patch from --- a/src/ls.c
down to the line --, just above 1.6.2.5.


IDEALLY, WHEN THE PATCH COMMAND IS WORKING, DO THE
FOLLOWING:
Look at "man patch" to see how patching works. Then in
the coreutils-7.6 directory, run:

patch -lp1 < ~/CS35L/lab3/patch
make

-l option for patch ignores white space
-pnum strips n prefixes from the file name when patching

NOTE: patch was applied manually because I kept getting the
error message:
**** malformed patch at line 10:

---

CONFIGURE was not needed because the files were already
configured, meaning the dependencies between files were
already checked and put into the makefile.

MAKE was needed because we needed to recompile the program
files since we modified ls.c. 

MAKE INSTALL was not needed because we were asked not to.
The executable was already created for ls using MAKE. We
do not need to reinstall the entire program into another
directory.

---

Once the patch is applied, we can test it in the
coreutils-7.6 directory by using:

./src/ls -l

And from this, we get the correct format with MM DD YYYY:
Oct 16 20:45

But if we go to the coreutilsInstall directory

./bin/ls -l

still gives the numerical YYYY-MM-DD:
2015-10-16

---

Next, I ran the following test cases:

Testing it on a recently modified function:

./coreutils-7.6/src/ls -l lab3.txt

Oct 16 20:50

Testing it on a file that is at least a year old:

(first artificially create an old file)

touch -t 199912251200 old_date
./coreutils-7.6/src/ls -l old_date

Dec 25 1999
