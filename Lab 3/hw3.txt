Homework 3

Q1: Removing "case_long_iso_time_style" was not
necessary to move. It was a goto line in the code
(not a switch case like the line before it). Since
we also deleted the line that said to goto that line,
leaving it in would not hurt the program. We deleted
it merely for clarity and readability.

Q2: The patch will potentially run into problems
where the locale does not have translations for both
long_time and long_iso_time formats. If the program
is run in a country that does not use English/English
-format dates, then the month will not be translated
correctly, which is perhaps why the number system was
used over words.

Q3: If we run randline.py on an empty file like
/dev/null, we get an error. The output is a traceback
of randline.py, and shows us that it fails at line 261
since the index is out of range. This is because we input
a file that has no lines, so the random sequence cannot
pick a random line from nothing.

Q4: Using python3 instead of python2 gives us a syntax
error at line 65, instead of printing out what it is
supposed to. This is because python3 changed its format
for automatic tuple unpacking. Automatic tuple unpacking
is when a tuple or list is allowed as a normal parameter.
This is not supported at line 65 for the tuple (errno,
strerror).
