Lab 6: SSH setup and use in applications

My partner for this lab was Shannon Phu. 

After opening ubuntu, we want to make sure we have both the openssh-server and
openssh-client installed. We check this using:

$ dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh

Mine did not have the server installed, so I installed it using:

$ sudo apt-get install openssh-server

------

First, I acted as the client. My first step was to generate public and private keys:

$ ssh-keygen

I saved the key, created a passphrase, and copied the public key to the server for key-based authentication:
It was saved to the directory (~/.ssh/authorized_keys)

$ ssh-copy-id -i collin2@10.97.85.125

At this point, the server warned me and showed the key fingerprint and asked if I wanted to continue.
I said yes, and continued from here.

Next, we add the private key to the authentication agent:

$ ssh-add

And now, I SSH to my partner's server:

$ ssh collin2@10.97.85.125

Lastly, I tested the following commands on the host and they all worked:

$ xterm
$ gedit
$ firefox

------

Next, I acted as the server host. I reused my public and private keys from the previous step.

I then created an account (username and password) for Shannon on my server:

$ sudo useradd -d /home/shannon -m shannon
$ sudo passwd shannon

After, I created the .ssh directory for my new user:

$ cd /home/shannon
$ sudo mkdir .ssh

I changed the ownership and permission on the newly created .ssh directory:

$ sudo chown -R shannon .ssh
$ sudo chmod 700 .ssh

In order for my partner to login I needed to obtain my IP address. I found it using:

$ ifconfig

The IP address for my server was: 10.97.85.162
